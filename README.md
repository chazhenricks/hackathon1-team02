# Git Gubmble

Git Gumble is a dating app for developers. The app gathers user information from Github and presents it in the form of a card with varying shades of green. The shade of green is directly correlated with how many commits to Github that person has made in the past year. Based solely on number of commits a potential match has made, the app user is then able to swipe right to follow ("Push" in the app) or left to not follow ("Pop") in the app. 

&nbsp;

Git Gumble was created as a team as part of the Nashville Software School 2017 Alumni Hackathon.

## Overview
The app was built using [Framer](https://framer.com/), a powerful prototyping tool to create fully functional, working mobile prototypes. Framer was used to construct the overall structure of the app as well as tie in functionality to buttons and swipes. 

&nbsp;

Framer uses Coffeescript rather than Javascript for its interactive functionality. This being my first introduction to Coffeescript, getting started had a well defined steep learning curve for me.

&nbsp;

My contributions to the project included 
1. Figuring out how to collaborate using Framer (surprisingly difficult to work on the same project at the same time using this tool)
1. Integrating functionality of populating new cards once one has been swiped
1. Integrating Firebase as a backend

&nbsp;

The project is still under construction. A version 2 release will be happening in the near future. Stay Tuned.
